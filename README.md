# Deep Learning Lab Experiments

This repository contains a series of **deep learning lab experiments** focused on implementation neural network architectures to understand their use cases and evaluate them.
Each experiment is organized in its own subfolder with a dedicated `README.md` explaining the objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.


## Overview of Experiments

1. **Neural Network Regressor**  
   - Implements a feedforward neural network for regression tasks.  
   - Explores model design, training dynamics, and evaluation using synthetic datasets.  

2. **Neural Network Optimizer**  
   - Compares different optimization algorithms (SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, Adam).  
   - Analyzes training speed, convergence, and final model performance.  

3. **Neural Network Regularization**  
   - Studies effects of L1, L2, and Dropout on overfitting and generalization.  
   - Evaluates models on a binary classification dataset.  

4. **CNN Classification**  
   - Builds a 1D convolutional neural network for synthetic image classification.  
   - Examines overfitting, batch normalization, and training techniques.  

5. **CNN Architecture**  
   - Experiments with CNN variants by modifying filters, kernel sizes, and pooling strategies.  
   - Compares performance across multiple architectures on image datasets.  

6. **RNN Baseline**
